# Introduction
Goal: Provide background, define the problem, and state your research objectives.
Problem Statement:  Describe why traditional methods fall short and why a framework like ehrapy is valuable.

The increasing digitization of healthcare systems has led to vast collections of electronic health records (EHRs), presenting both opportunities and challenges for medical research [1]. While these datasets contain valuable insights for improving patient care, their heterogeneous nature
and lack of standardized analysis approaches have limited their utility [2]. Two recent developments offer promising directions for addressing these challenges: the ehrapy framework, an opensource Python package designed specifically for exploratory analysis of EHR data [2], and advances in machine learning approaches for EHR phenotyping [1]. EHR phenotyping is the process of using electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patients
with a specific characteristic or condition. This process is important for research purposes, such as identifying patients for clinical trials.

ehrapy incorporates a series of analytical steps, from data extraction and quality control to the gneration of low-dimension feature representations. Complemented by rich statistical modules, ehrapy facilitates associating patients with disease states, differential comparison between patient clusters, survival analysis, trajectory inference, causal inference and more. Leveraging ontologies, ehrapy further enables data sharing and training EHR deep learning models, paving the way for foundational models in biomedical research. 

Research Objectives:
- Replication: Validating ehrapyâ€™s ability to stratify pneumonia patients (adapting the original pediatric analysis to adults in MIMIC-IV).
- Extension: Implementing machine learning (e.g., RNNs) to enhance phenotyping.

Our project had two complementary aims: First, to validate ehrapyâ€™s effectiveness and generalizability we replicated key analyses from the original paper that had used ehrapy to stratify pediatric patients (PIC database) affected by unspecified pneumonia into finer-grained phenotypes. We validated this work by implementing the same methodology but in an adult cohort and using the MIMIC-IV dataset [3]. Second, we extended the framework by implementing a machine learning approach to predict in-hospital mortality for each of our clustered groups.  Our dual approach was used to both validate the original methodological framework and python tools and demonstrate its potential for supporting more sophisticated analytical techniques.

# Lit Review

Electronic health records (EHRs) have become integral to modern healthcare due to standardized data collection and digitalization. While they provide a comprehensive record of patient history, their high-dimensional, heterogeneous structureâ€”spanning structured clinical codes, unstructured notes, and temporal dataâ€”poses signficant challenges for analysis. Data mining techniques, including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and predictive modeling, are essential to extract meaningful insights. These methods have enabled disease prediction and classification, population health analysis, treatment optimization, clinical trial simulation, and patient stratification, demonstrating the transformative potential of quantitative approaches in healthcare.

## MIMIC-IV dataset

The MIMIC-IV database provides an ideal test ground for this work, containing comprehensive clinical data from ICU and non-ICU patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [3]. Its structured format and rich clinical information enable direct comparison with analyses performed on the original Pediatric Intensive Care (PIC) database [4], while its scope and complexity make it suitable for testing advanced machine learning implementations
