Structuring the Prediction Window for Your Clinic
Since your clinic provides mental health services, the ideal prediction window should balance timeliness and actionability while considering operational constraints.

How far ahead should we predict?

1 week ‚Üí Too short, might not give enough lead time for scheduling.
2 weeks ‚Üí Seems reasonable, allowing for short-term adjustments.
3 weeks ‚Üí Could work, but risk of increased uncertainty.
4+ weeks ‚Üí Might be too far to make accurate predictions.
üí° Best choice: 2 weeks (rolling window)

Gives clinicians enough time to plan and allocate resources.
Keeps the data recent, minimizing shifts in client needs.
Matches real-world scheduling cycles (biweekly adjustments).
How to Handle New vs. Returning Clients
New clients don‚Äôt have historical service hours, no-show counts, or crisis events. You have two main approaches:

Approach 1: One Model with Missing Data Handling (Recommended)
Use a single model, but encode missing values explicitly.
Create a ‚ÄúNew Client‚Äù flag (is_new_client = 1).
For missing features (e.g., days_since_last_crisis), replace them with:
A large placeholder (e.g., 999) ‚Üí Let the model learn this means "no history".
A new category (e.g., "unknown" for categorical variables).
A binary indicator (has_no_show_history = 0 for new clients).
üí° Pros:

Simpler deployment, only one model to maintain.
The model learns how to treat missing values naturally.
Avoids overfitting to different client types.
Approach 2: Two Separate Models (More Complex)
Model 1: Predicts for new clients (only intake + demographics).
Model 2: Predicts for returning clients (uses historical data).
üí° Pros:

More specialized for each case.
Might improve accuracy since new clients are fundamentally different.
üí° Cons:

Requires twice the work for training, tuning, and deployment.
Might be unnecessary if a single model can handle both well.
How to Encode Features to Handle Missing Data
If you use Approach 1 (Single Model), here‚Äôs how to encode key features:

Feature	Existing Clients	New Clients
total_hours_last_4_weeks	Actual value (e.g., 8)	0
days_since_last_meeting	Actual value (e.g., 3)	999
days_since_last_no_show	Actual value (e.g., 14)	999
has_no_show_history	1 (if exists)	0
is_new_client	0	1
